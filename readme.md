# Tehran Traffic Big Data Analysis Using Spark

As part of my Massive Data Analysis course project, I conducted research on implementing and analyzing various big data and machine learning algorithms using Spark and Hadoop. Specifically, I focused on algorithms such as Apriori, LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing), CF-ALS (Collaborative Filtering with Alternating Least Squares), HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search), SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), and PIXIE on Tehran Traffic data.

The main objective of the project was to detect anomaly patterns in the driving behavior of drivers in Tehran using speed control cameras. By analyzing the data from these cameras, we aimed to identify any abnormal driving patterns that may indicate traffic violations or unsafe driving practices.
Additionally, another aspect of the project involved predicting traffic in different locations throughout the city. By leveraging the collected data and applying machine learning techniques, we aimed to develop models that could accurately forecast traffic conditions in various parts of Tehran. This information would be valuable for traffic management and congestion control purposes.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the application of big data algorithms for traffic analysis and prediction. we aimed to contribute to the development of effective traffic management strategies in Tehran.
